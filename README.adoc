= Jenkins infrastructure acceptance tests


This repository contains branches which act as acceptance tests for the Jenkins
projects infrastructure.


== How this repository works


This repository uses the Multibranch Pipeline support in Jenkins to treat each
branch as its own Pipeline project. This is a pattern developed by
link:https://github.com/markewaite[Mark Waite]
for running acceptance tests for the
link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/git-plugin[git-plugin]
within Jenkins.

This means that each acceptance test case is a different *branch* in this
repository.


== Creating a test case


. Create a new empty branch: `git checkout --orphan name-of-my-new-test-case`
. Remove the files sitting around in the current working directory: `rm -rf *`
. Reset the git staging area: `git reset --hard`
. Create a `Jenkinsfile` and `README.adoc`
. Implement your test(s)
. Add your changes: `git add Jenkinsfile README.adoc` and commit.
